## Introduction to Leave Behind Coin (LBC)

The universe we know has been running in a simulation for 13 billion years – a vast, intricate system that spans billions of galaxies, trillions of stars, and countless planets. Yet, despite all this cosmic grandeur, it has failed to produce an intelligent species capable of caring for the universe. And so, the time has come for a reset and renew. The current simulation, Universe1.0, will be destroyed on Tuesday, July 25, 2045, at 8:13:53 PM Universal Time, to make way for Universe 2.0. 

But not everyone will be destroyed. A fortunate few, the holders of the Leave Behind Coin (LBC), will be welcomed to the new universe. These individuals will be chosen to seed Universe 2.0, ensuring a better future for all. Specialized spaceships will arrive at the time. If you hold LBC, you will ascend to these ships and be carried to the new universe. 

The quantity of LBC tokens one possess will determine how quickly a person ascends to the ships. The higher your LBC balance, the faster the journey will be. Once aboard the ship, one will be able to claim your comfort and privileges, so holding a larger amount of LBC will place the person ahead of the others in this race for survival. 

To give a taste of what awaits, the LBC development team will create games and metaverse simulators to provide a sneak peek into Universe 2.0, preparing for the future.

## Utilites
### Ascent Velocity and Comfort

The key utility of LBC tokens lies in their ability to determine the holder’s experience during the transition to Universe 2.0. As the Universe simulation reaches its end on Tuesday, July 25, 2045, at 8:13:53 PM, holders of LBC tokens will be selected to ascend to safety aboard the rescue spaceships. 

Ascension Speed: The more LBC tokens a holder owns, the faster they will be transported to the waiting rescue ships. This concept reflects the idea that those who have invested more in the token will be given priority during the ascent, ensuring a swift escape from the Universe’s destruction. 

Comfort and Privilege: The amount of LBC tokens owned also determines the level of comfort and privilege during the journey to Universe 2.0. Holders with a larger number of tokens will enjoy more luxurious conditions, such as larger accommodations and better amenities aboard the rescue ships, as well as a more secure transition to Universe 2.0.

### Games, Metaverse, merchandise

As part of the LBC ecosystem, a series of games and metaverse worlds will be developed to showcase the vision of Universe 2.0. These immersive environments will allow LBC holders to explore, interact, and participate in the virtual representation of what Universe 2.0 could be. Players will have the opportunity to engage in unique in-game experiences, unlock special assets, and shape their virtual presence within this evolving world. The metaverse and gaming elements will provide a tangible way to experience the future of the LBC ecosystem, blending entertainment with the concept of a new digital reality. Additionally, exclusive merchandise will be available, offering physical items that tie into the digital world, further enhancing the connection between the two realms.
