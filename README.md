## Introduction to Leave Behind Coin (LBC)

The universe we know has been running in a simulation for 13 billion years – a vast, intricate system that spans billions of galaxies, trillions of stars, and countless planets. Yet, despite all this cosmic grandeur, it has failed to produce an intelligent species capable of caring for the universe. And so, the time has come for a reset and renew. The current simulation, Universe1.0, will be destroyed on Tuesday, July 25, 2045, at 8:13:53 PM Universal Time, to make way for Universe 2.0. 

But not everyone will be destroyed. A fortunate few, the holders of the Leave Behind Coin (LBC), will be welcomed to the new universe. These individuals will be chosen to seed Universe 2.0, ensuring a better future for all. Specialized spaceships will arrive at the time. If you hold LBC, you will ascend to these ships and be carried to the new universe. 

The quantity of LBC tokens one possess will determine how quickly a person ascends to the ships. The higher your LBC balance, the faster the journey will be. Once aboard the ship, one will be able to claim your comfort and privileges, so holding a larger amount of LBC will place the person ahead of the others in this race for survival. 

To give a taste of what awaits, the LBC development team will create games and metaverse simulators to provide a sneak peek into Universe 2.0, preparing for the future.
